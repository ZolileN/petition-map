The Government wants to change this so that everyone can be confident that they will receive the same level of care whatever day of the week they are admitted to an NHS hospital.\r\n \r\nNHS consultants already provide an outstanding service and show great dedication to ensuring patients get the best outcomes. But the Government has a duty to make sure the system is set up in a way which makes it as easy as possible for hospitals to organise their resources to maximise patient safety across every day of the week.\r\n\r\nTo understand more about the possible issues for staff contracts, last year the government asked the independent pay review bodies for NHS staff - The Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration (DDRB) and the NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) for their observations and recommendations about how the reform of employment contracts could help support the delivery of seven day services in England. \r\n\r\nThe reports were published this month. They identified that a major barrier to seven day services is a decade old contractual right in the consultants’ contract negotiated by their union representatives in 2003 that allows senior doctors to refuse to work non-emergency work in the evenings, at nights and at weekends. No junior doctor, nurse or other clinical group has any such right. Other senior public sector professionals who work in services required to keep the public safe, such as police officers, firemen and prison governors, do not have this opt out either.\r\n\r\nWhilst the vast majority of consultants work tirelessly for their patients, the opt out allows individuals to charge employers hugely expensive payments which are much higher than national contract rates (up to £200 an hour). The average earnings for a hospital consultant are already in the top 2% in the country at £118,000, and these inflated payments can make it difficult for hospitals to provide the weekend cover they know patients need.\r\n \r\nThe report endorsed  the removal of the opt out, as well as broadly supporting other changes to the consultant contract that would ensure the right level of cover is available every day of the week; not just Monday to Friday.\r\n\r\nUnder the new plans, doctors will still continue to receive a significantly higher rate for working unsocial hours and there will be a contractual limit (not an expectation) of working a maximum of 13 weekends a year.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Parliament, the Government hopes that the majority of consultants, in line with existing practice for nurses, midwives and junior doctors, will be on reformed contracts, working across seven days, to deliver a better service to patients. Hospitals like Salford Royal and Northumbria that have instituted seven day services have already seen improvements in patient care and staff morale. \r\n\r\nThese new plans will mean that doctors working in some of the toughest areas in the NHS, such as A\u0026E and obstetrics, will at last be properly rewarded and there will be faster pay progression for all consultants early on in their career. Under the new proposals, the highest performing consultants could be able to receive up to £30,000 a year in bonus payments, on top of their base salary.\r\n\r\nOf course, improving weekend care requires more than just ensuring greater consultant presence.  That's why the government is also addressing issues such as access to weekend diagnostic services, provision of out of hospital care to facilitate weekend discharges, and adequate staffing cover amongst other clinical groups,. But NHS leaders and the independent pay review bodies are clear that increasing the presence of senior clinical decision makers at weekends is vital, and that the consultant opt out remains a barrier to organising broader support services and staff rotas.\r\n\r\nThe Government feels it is under an obligation to the public to do all it can to make NHS care at the weekend as safe as during the week through the delivery of seven day services this Parliament and that is what it will continue to do.  \r\n","created_at":"2015-07-24T10:15:58.247Z","updated_at":"2015-07-24T10:15:58.247Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":104349,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104349.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make the production, sale and use of cannabis legal.","background":"Legalising cannabis could bring in £900m in taxes every year, save £400m on policing cannabis and create over 10,000 new jobs. \r\n\r\nA substance that is safer than alcohol, and has many uses.

Legalisation of cannabis would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery that this can cause to families.\r\n\r\nLegalisation would also send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs.\r\n \r\nDespite the potential opportunity offered by legalisation to raise revenue through taxation, there would be costs in relation to administrative, compliance and law enforcement activities, as well as the wider costs of drug prevention and health services.\r\n\r\nThe UK's approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities; help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support; while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply and tackling the organised crime that is associated with the drugs trade. The Government will build on the Drugs Strategy by continuing to take a balanced and coherent approach to address the evolving challenges posed.\r\n\r\nThere are positive signs that the Government’s approach is working: there has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade, and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009/10.

As the Prime Minister said, we were all deeply saddened by the violence and the UK has been at the forefront of international reconstruction efforts.  However the Prime Minister was clear on the UK’s recognition of Israel’s right to take proportionate action to defend itself, within the boundaries of international humanitarian law. We condemn the terrorist tactics of Hamas who fired rockets on Israel, built extensive tunnels to kidnap and murder, and repeatedly refused to accept ceasefires.  Israel, like any state, has the right to ensure its own security, as its citizens also have the right to live without fear of attack.  \r\n\r\nThe UK consistently urged Israel to do everything possible to avoid civilian casualties, to exercise restraint, and to help find ways to bring the situation to an end.  The UK continues to urge the parties to give priority to reaching a durable solution for Gaza which addresses the underlying drivers of conflict, and to take the necessary practical steps to ensure Gaza’s reconstruction and economic recovery.\r\n\r\nWe welcome the fact that Israel is conducting internal investigations into specific incidents during Operation Protective Edge.  Where there is evidence of wrongdoing those responsible must be held accountable whatever their position in society.  Both parties must also demonstrate robust and credible internal investigations which are in line with international standards.  We have also encouraged the Israeli authorities, as we do all countries, to cooperate with the independent Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding the preliminary examination into the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories since 13 June, 2014, whilst noting that Israel is not a State Party to the ICC.\r\n\r\nThe UK is a close friend of Israel and we enjoy an excellent bilateral relationship, built on decades of cooperation between our two countries across a range of fields.

The UK has some of the best wind, wave and tidal resources in Europe. Renewable energy offers an attractive market for investors, one that already supports skills and jobs through the supply chain. \r\n\r\nWe are currently implementing a renewable energy deployment programme to ensure we generate at least 30% of our electricity from renewables by 2020. At the end of 2013, our share of electricity generation from renewable energy was 14.9%. In 2014 this figure rose to 19.2%, and a record of 22.3% was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. Since 2010 we have seen an average of £7 billion a year of investment in renewables and last year we reached a record high of almost £8 billion. \r\n\r\nAround a third of UK energy demand is met by gas, the cleanest fossil fuel.  A quarter of that is used to produce electricity, some is a vital ingredient for industry and nearly all the rest is used to heat our buildings and cook our food. So it’s vital that we seize the opportunity to explore the UK’s shale gas potential whilst maintaining the very highest safety and environmental standards, which we have established as world leaders in extracting oil and gas over the past 50 years. The Government is committed to developing this new source of energy as part of our work to ensure our energy security. Developing shale gas could create a whole new British industry, provide more jobs and make us less reliant on volatile imports from abroad. \r\n\r\nReports by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, as well as Public Health England considered a wide range of evidence on hydraulic fracturing in the UK context. They concluded that risks can be well managed if the industry follows best practice, enforced through regulation. The UK has over 50 years’ experience regulating the onshore oil and gas industry, and measures are in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent environmental contamination, mitigate seismic activity and minimise emissions. A company looking to develop shale will still need to obtain all the necessary permissions, like planning and environmental permits. Our system is robust and we are proven world leaders in well regulated, safe and environmentally sound oil and gas developments. \r\n\r\nTo reinforce these regulations, the Infrastructure Act 2015 brought forward a range of further requirements if an operator is to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward in a balanced way. These include environmental impact assessments, groundwater monitoring, community payments and the exclusion of hydraulic fracturing in protected areas. \r\n\r\nIt is important that local communities who are hosting wells are able to share in the benefits of development. The industry has committed to provide £100,000 in community payments per fractured well and 1% of any subsequent production revenues. Companies may well offer payments over and above these amounts. \r\n\r\nUK shale development is compatible with our goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and does not detract from our support for renewables. As the UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said in 2013, the UK will “continue to use considerable, albeit declining, amounts of gas well into the 2030s” and “if anything, using well-regulated UK shale gas… could lead to lower overall greenhouse gas emissions than continuing to import gas”. The CCC is an independent, statutory body, whose purpose is to advise the UK Government and Devolved Administrations on emissions targets and report to Parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. Shale gas can create a bridge while we develop renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and build new nuclear. To make absolutely sure, we have included in the Infrastructure Act a requirement to seek advice from the CCC on the implications of shale gas for our legally binding carbon targets. \r\n\r\nThis is not a renewables versus gas issue – to meet our challenging climate targets we will need significant quantities of renewables, nuclear and gas in our energy mix.\r\n","created_at":"2015-08-06T09:42:16.664Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T09:42:16.664Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":104471,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104471.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Vote no confidence in David Cameron","background":"The current Tory government has caused devastation for the poorest in society for the last 5 years.

We want students to fulfil their potential both academically and in terms of their mental wellbeing and this attainment is best supported if they have good mental health, character and resilience. They are two sides of the same coin. We know that teachers across the country are already doing excellent work to develop character and resilience, and we are committed to helping them continue that work. Character education is a central part of our plan for education and we have already invested £5 million to build and better understand what works, share good practice and encourage all schools to ensure their pupils leave resilient and with the ability to thrive in modern Britain.\r\n\r\nWe know that the vast majority of secondary schools already teach their pupils about mental health. The CentreForum report in December 2014 found that 94% of secondary schools surveyed already promote positive mental health through lessons such as PSHE or drama or through school assemblies. It is important that schools should be free to develop approaches to supporting mental health that suit their particular circumstances and we want to make sure that schools are able to do this well. \r\n\r\nWhat is important is the quality of the teaching and we know that schools and teachers have not always been sure what is appropriate and how to approach some of the difficult issues. That is why we funded the PSHE Association to provide new mental health guidance and resources. These new lesson plans support age-appropriate teaching about dealing with emotions and talking about anxieties and worries. As children grow older, the lessons cover more specific teaching about mental illnesses. Learning about good mental health will help to reduce the stigma of mental illness, help children recognise when they are feeling pressured and enable them to feel able to ask for help. Nearly 2,000 pupils have been involved in developing these materials.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognise that effective support for children and young people’s mental health involves more than just what happens within lessons. Some young people will need more targeted support such as counselling and our recent guidance, which was published in March, gives schools advice on how to deliver high quality school-based counselling. It emphasises how counselling works best as part of a whole-school approach to wellbeing and provides schools with practical, evidence-based advice. It was developed by working with schools and counselling experts and our expectation is that is over time all schools will want to provide access to counselling services.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to promote awareness of potential mental issues and support the development of schools and teachers knowledge. MindEd, funded by the Department of Health, has been developed to enable all adults working with children and young people learn more about mental health problems and how to support them. This year the Department for Education has given MindEd a grant of over £550,000 to create additional resources for families. We are also working closely with the sector to further improve the quality of teachers’ initial teacher training and support their continued professional development.\r\n\r\nBut teachers and school staff are not mental health professionals. They need to have timely access to specialist support for those children and young people who need it. That’s why the Department for Education is investing £1.5million in piloting a joint training programme with NHS England for lead contacts in schools and specialist services to help them work together as effectively as possible. In addition to this we are providing £4.7million this year for 17 mental health projects led by voluntary and community sector organisations in order to trial new ways of supporting young people and their families. These include projects to promote positive mental health in schools, improving the information and advice available to families and setting up networks of young people to act as mental health ambassadors.\r\n\r\nThis government is firmly committed to continue working to deliver the transformation we need to see if we are genuinely to improve children and young people’s mental health and we are working across departments to rise to the challenges set out in the Future in Mind report. The Department of Health have committed an additional £1.25billion of funding which will be used to help radically improve mental health services for children, young people and new mothers over the next 5 years. Our ambition is to transform young peoples’ experience of mental health support by increasing knowledge, acting to destigmatise mental illness; and making specialist services more accessible and responsive to the needs of children and young people.  \r\n","created_at":"2015-08-11T14:05:56.131Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T14:05:56.131Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":104534,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104534.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Extend Harvey's Mandate To All Council Roads ensuring all animals are scanned.","background":"Harvey's Mandate was implemented by HM Government in March 2015.
